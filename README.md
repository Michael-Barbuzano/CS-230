Software design document for The Gaming Room

  The Gaming Room is a game development company.  The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms and is based on their current game Draw it or Lose it, which is only available on Android.  One thing that I think I did particularly well on when creating this software design document was evaluating each operating platform.  By doing extensive research, I believe I was able to provide an extensive and insightful evaluation of each operating software, specifically around The Gaming Room's requirements.  I found the UML diagram the be the most helpful for developing the code for this project.  By utilizing the UML diagram, I was able to clearly visualize and understand how the program should function.  If I had to revise any part of the software design document, I would choose the reccommendations section.  Although I think I did a decent job at providing an insighful recccommendation with extensive explanations, I would want to get more experience in the field utilizing multiple different operating systems to give a more professional reccommendation.
