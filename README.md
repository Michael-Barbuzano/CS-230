Software design document for The Gaming Room

  The Gaming Room is a game development company.  The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms and is based on their current game Draw it or Lose it, which is only available on Android.  One thing that I think I did particularly well on when creating this software design document was evaluating each operating platform.  By doing extensive research, I believe I was able to provide an extensive and insightful evaluation of each operating software, specifically around The Gaming Room's requirements.
